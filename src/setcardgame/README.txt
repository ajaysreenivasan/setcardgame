Currently, there is no difference in functionality with regards to the number of players specified as long as it's an integer.

For a "standard" deck where there is a card with each permutation of values for the parameters, specify "-1" as the number of cards in the deck. The deck will be shuffled randomly before play begins. Otherwise, for a randomly generated set of cards, any other number will do. The program will create a deck of the given size.

Once the program as run, it will print out the cards left on the table as well as the sets that it has found.
